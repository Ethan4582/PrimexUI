Effect	Variable	Example Value
Height of explosion	verticalForce	22 (increase it)
Number of images	imageParticleCount	5 (increase it)
Gravity (fall speed)	gravity	0.25 (lower/slower)
Explosion duration	resetDelay	500 (increase it)


Time (duration): Change resetDelay in the config object.
This is the time (in ms) before the explosion resets.
resetDelay: 500, // Increase for longer explosion before reset

The time and gravity of the explosion:

Gravity: Change gravity in the config object.
Lower gravity for a slower fall, higher for a faster fall.



gravity: 0.25, // Lower = slower fall, higher = faster fall

How many images explode:
Change the value of imageParticleCount.

Increase this number to have more images in the explosion.
const imageParticleCount = 5; // Increase this for more images
How high the image will go:
Change the value of verticalForce in the config object.

Increase verticalForce for a higher explosion (images go higher).

verticalForce: 22, // Increase this value for higher explosion
